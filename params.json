[D4](https://github.com/heavysixer/d4) is the default charting framework.\r\nChartbuilder powers all chart creation on [Atlas](http://atlas.qz.com), a\r\ncharting platform developed by Quartz.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in Chartbuilder 2.0\r\n-------------------------\r\n* The Chart Grid type. Use it to create small multiples of bars, lines, dots, or columns.\r\n* The app has been rewritten in React.js, making it easier to add new chart types or use\r\nthird-party rendering libraries, like we are with D4.\r\n* Chart edits are automatically saved to localStorage, and a chart can be\r\nrecovered by clicking the \"load previous chart\" button on loading the page.\r\n* Data input now accepts csv formatted data as well as tsv formated data\r\n* All UI elements belong to [Chartbuilder UI](https://github.com/Quartz/chartbuilder-ui),\r\na framework of flexible React components that you can use in other projects.\r\n\r\nWhat Chartbuilder is not\r\n-------------------------\r\n+ A replacement for Excel\r\n+ A replacement for Google Spreadsheet\r\n+ A data analysis tool\r\n+ A data transformation tool\r\n\r\nWhat Chartbuilder is\r\n--------------------\r\nChartbuilder is the final step in charting to create charts in a consistent predefined style. Paste data into it and export the code to draw a mobile friendly responsive chart or a static svg or png chart.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is using Chartbuilder\r\n--------------------\r\nOther than Quartz, customized Chartbuilder created charts have been seen in many publications:\r\n+ [NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/10/24/240493422/in-most-every-european-country-bikes-are-outselling-cars)\r\n+ [The Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/07/for-korean-kids-mobile-chat-rules/)\r\n+ [CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101009116)\r\n+ [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2013/12/2013-the-year-in-charts.html)\r\n+ [The Press-Enterprise](http://blog.pe.com/political-empire/2013/07/31/ppic-poll-global-warming-a-concern-for-inland-voters/)\r\n+ [New Hampshire Public Radio](http://nhpr.org/post/water-cleanup-commences-beede-story-shows-superfund-laws-flaws)\r\n+ [CFO Magazine](http://ww2.cfo.com/the-economy/2013/11/retail-sales-growth-stalls/)\r\n+ [Australian Broadcasting Corporation](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-11/nobel-prize3a-why-2001-was-the-best-year-to-win/5016010)\r\n+ [Digiday](http://digiday.com/publishers/5-charts-tell-state-digital-publishing/)\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting started with Chartbuilder\r\n---------------------------------\r\nIf you are not interested in customizing the styles of your charts use the hosted version: http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder\r\n\r\nTo work on the Chartbuilder code, first download the project and install\r\ndependencies:\r\n\r\n####Download via github\r\n1.
